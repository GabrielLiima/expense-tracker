## How to use

This is a basic react app that tracks expenses. All you have to do is <b>use the form</b> to insert an
expense/income and it'll show up on the history.

You can also <b>delete a transaction by clicking on it</b>, and then on the red button that appears.

This project is still under development, and will be improved overtime. Contributions are always appreciated!
